# FoodRun

Having a plan when running to the store.

Making food at home saves money, but in order to make sure you use it all up, it
helps to have a plan.

This app, built with a Rails API and a JavaScript front end, is a simple recipe
keeper. With a later update, it will have the ability to produce a grocery list
from the recipes you choose for the week.

# Getting Started

Most importantly, remember to **go slowly and be methodical**. That means you
should be testing your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code.
Always be commiting. Deploy early and often.
